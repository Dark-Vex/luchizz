luchizz
=======

**Make any Linux shell like home.**

**WARNING UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

Tested on:
 - Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty
 - Debian 7.7 Wheezy

Luchizz was originally implemented as bash script to modify a Linux
installation to be more confortable and usable with some customization
especially for shell usage.
With this github repo I'm starting to rewrite the script in python using fabric
library in order to deploy remotely (via ssh) commonly used packages and shell
improvements.

Features
--------

**Shell improvements**
 - Pag UP/DOWN to search in the command history
 - Different prompt colors for normal user and root
 - Human readable output for ls, df, free
 - Colorized output for ls, grep
 - Aliases for ls, rm
 - Extended command history
 and more..

**Extra commands**
 - ``z`` jump around shell script
 - ``detectip`` what's my ip command
