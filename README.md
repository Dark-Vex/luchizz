luchizz
=======

**Make any Linux shell like home.**

**WARNING UNSTABLE AND UNTESTED this is a draft**

Luchizz was originally implemented as bash script to modify a Linux installation to be more confortable and usable with some customization especially for shell usage.
With this github repo I'm starting to rewrite the script in python using fabric library in order to deploy remotely (via ssh) commonly used packages and shell improvements.

Original authors for the shell version:
